# Travel World Website

This project is a travel website where users can view popular destinations, book hotels, and get in touch with the support team through a contact form. The website is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js with MongoDB** for the backend. 

The project allows users to submit the contact form, which is then saved in a MongoDB database.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel-website.git
cd travel-website
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend (React)

Go to the **frontend** directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend (Node.js with MongoDB)

Go to the **backend** directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

## Frontend Setup (React)

The frontend is a **React** app that interacts with the backend API.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. The frontend communicates with the backend using API calls (e.g., contact form submission). The URL for the backend is set to **localhost:5000** during local development.

### Running the Frontend Locally

After installation, you can run the frontend using:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be running on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. You can visit this URL in your browser to see the React app.

---

## Backend Setup (Node.js with MongoDB)

The backend of this project is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, and uses **MongoDB** for storing data (e.g., contact form submissions).

### Steps for setting up the backend:

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the **`backend`** folder to store sensitive information like MongoDB URI:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/travelworld  # Local MongoDB URI for development
   PORT=5000
   ```

### Running the Backend Locally

Start the backend server by running:

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend will run on **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**.

---

## Running the Application

To run the full application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the backend** (Node.js + MongoDB):

   * Open a terminal window and navigate to the `backend` directory:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   * Run the backend:

     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

2. **Start the frontend** (React):

   * Open another terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   * Run the frontend:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

Now, your full application will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and will communicate with the backend running at **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**.

---

## Testing

1. **Contact Form Test:**

   * Go to the **Contact Us** page on the frontend.
   * Submit a test message with **name**, **email**, and **message**.
   * After submitting, the data should be stored in the **MongoDB** database under the **`Contact`** collection.

2. **Check MongoDB:**

   * Open **MongoDB Compass** and navigate to your **`travelworld`** database.
   * You should see the **`Contact`** collection with the submitted data.

---

## Deployment

This project is intended for local use and doesn't use any cloud services. However, if you'd like to deploy it later:

* **Frontend**: You can deploy the React app using platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
* **Backend**: You can deploy the Node.js backend using **Heroku** or **AWS**.

## FAQ

1. **How do I connect to MongoDB if I don't want to use localhost?**

   You can use **MongoDB Atlas** to host your MongoDB database. Replace the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file with the connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

2. **Can I use a different database?**

   Yes, the backend is designed to be flexible. You can replace MongoDB with other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL by adjusting the backend code accordingly.

3. **How can I add new features?**

   You can extend the project by adding new pages, modifying the UI in React, or adding more endpoints in the backend. For example, you can add **booking** functionality for the hotels or **activities** section.
