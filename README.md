# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

=======
Certainly! Here's a sample **README.md** file for your assignment project website, which will include detailed steps for setting up the project, running it locally, and all other necessary instructions. You can customize it further as per your specific requirements.

### Sample README.md:

# Travel World Website

This project is a travel website where users can view popular destinations, book hotels, and get in touch with the support team through a contact form. The website is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js with MongoDB** for the backend. 

The project allows users to submit the contact form, which is then saved in a MongoDB database.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/travel-website.git
cd travel-website
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Frontend (React)

Go to the **frontend** directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Backend (Node.js with MongoDB)

Go to the **backend** directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

---

## Frontend Setup (React)

The frontend is a **React** app that interacts with the backend API.

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install all dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. The frontend communicates with the backend using API calls (e.g., contact form submission). The URL for the backend is set to **localhost:5000** during local development.

### Running the Frontend Locally

After installation, you can run the frontend using:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be running on **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**. You can visit this URL in your browser to see the React app.

---

## Backend Setup (Node.js with MongoDB)

The backend of this project is built using **Node.js** and **Express**, and uses **MongoDB** for storing data (e.g., contact form submissions).

### Steps for setting up the backend:

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file inside the **`backend`** folder to store sensitive information like MongoDB URI:

   ```plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/travelworld  # Local MongoDB URI for development
   PORT=5000
   ```

### Running the Backend Locally

Start the backend server by running:

```bash
node server.js
```

The backend will run on **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**.

---

## Running the Application

To run the full application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the backend** (Node.js + MongoDB):

   * Open a terminal window and navigate to the `backend` directory:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   * Run the backend:

     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

2. **Start the frontend** (React):

   * Open another terminal window and navigate to the `frontend` directory:

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   * Run the frontend:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

Now, your full application will be available at **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and will communicate with the backend running at **[http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)**.

---

## Testing

1. **Contact Form Test:**

   * Go to the **Contact Us** page on the frontend.
   * Submit a test message with **name**, **email**, and **message**.
   * After submitting, the data should be stored in the **MongoDB** database under the **`Contact`** collection.

2. **Check MongoDB:**

   * Open **MongoDB Compass** and navigate to your **`travelworld`** database.
   * You should see the **`Contact`** collection with the submitted data.

---

## Deployment

This project is intended for local use and doesn't use any cloud services. However, if you'd like to deploy it later:

* **Frontend**: You can deploy the React app using platforms like **Netlify** or **Vercel**.
* **Backend**: You can deploy the Node.js backend using **Heroku** or **AWS**.

---

## FAQ

1. **How do I connect to MongoDB if I don't want to use localhost?**

   You can use **MongoDB Atlas** to host your MongoDB database. Replace the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file with the connection string from MongoDB Atlas.

2. **Can I use a different database?**

   Yes, the backend is designed to be flexible. You can replace MongoDB with other databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL by adjusting the backend code accordingly.

3. **How can I add new features?**

   You can extend the project by adding new pages, modifying the UI in React, or adding more endpoints in the backend. For example, you can add **booking** functionality for the hotels or **activities** section.
